# On Aug 7,2013: I placed these files as github repository:
	# As of todaytThis is largely skeleton code, but it is functional with provided example input.
	# The code is meant for taking results from a WG flat file + copies estimate from <TK> 
	# and applying a filter for meaninful qPCR results.
	# That is, we make an object recording results from a given assay/sample pairing at a high and low dilution.
		# A field records the ratio. We then have an option of thowing out results where we saw no difference between dilute and concentrated samples, suggestive of problematic assay
	# GOALS:
		#(1)  Add a screen for multiple peaks in the melting curve
		#(2)  Distinguish between ext, spec, pr assays
